# sillaj-l
A re-coding of the Sillaj time tracker tool using the Laravel php framework.

This is my first application using the Laravel php Framework.

It's a port of the simple, but highly functional time tracking tool, Sillaj.

Because it is simple, and incorporates many features of most web applications, it seemed like a good place to start with Laravel. In addition, the code is getting pretty old, and some features in my personal installation aren't working smoothly anymore.

The original GPL license is in effect.

Presuming I finish the port, I intend to add some more features, as necessity dictates and time allows.
